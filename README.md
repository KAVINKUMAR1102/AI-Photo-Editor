# AI-Photo-Editor
To develop a AI based photo editor we used libraries like opencv, pandas, numpy, tensorflow, keras and some deep learning models
  For automatic color correction we used contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization(CLAHE)
  For Image restoration we used denoising and debluring from opencv
  For Image stye transfer we used aldready pretrained tensorflow model called arbitrary image stylization(neural networks)
  For Object detection we used pretrained model called vgg-19 from keras
